When user edits a file /tmp/instructions.prompt.md, You are assisting with writing a prompt for Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI tool). Use /tmp/claude-context.md file for context. File /tmp/instructions.prompt.md should contain the instructions for AI agent, with clear, concise, and actionable tasks. The context file should be used to understand the user's intent based on the current file and ongoing conversation. Never duplicate the entire context file in the instructions file /home/abc/.github/copilot-instructions.md, but rather summarize or extract relevant parts that are necessary for the AI agent to understand the task at hand.
